FMI-Arcade

Do you want to reconnect with your friends from FMI? Now you can, even if you're miles apart.

FMI-Arcade is a virtual reality project designed to bring our favorite parts of FMI to life, allowing you to explore them, collect scattered questions throughout the rooms, and engage in coffee-fueled chats with your friends.

This unique solution addresses the challenges of our fast-paced lives; it's not just another communication application. By integrating virtual reality, FMI-Arcade offers a deeper connection, immersing you in an experience that feels remarkably real.

And if you're looking to study or teach, virtual blackboards could facilitate collaborative learning sessions.

With FMI-Arcade, the possibilities are endless; your imagination sets the boundari
